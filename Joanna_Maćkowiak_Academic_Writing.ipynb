        "#### The aim of the project was to analyse **language used for presentation and promotion**. The study focused on **an educational institution**. [Article promoting Univeristy of Gdańsk](https://en.ug.edu.pl/university/about_us) was selected for the analysis. The ratio of stopwords in words and tokens were checked in the research.\n",

        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "#### **Univeristy of Gdańsk**, being **largest** educational institution in the northern Poland, is placed around ***10th*** place in various rankings of higher education institutions in the country. In 2019, it did not get status of research university, thus the subsidies received were reduced. Due to remote learning, caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the aspect of the location of the university was less crucial when choosing place of study than in previous years. Consequently, in 2020/2021 academic year we could observe greater competition for students between higher educational institutions. As a result, promotion and university branding gained significant attention. However, in times of difficult travel between countries content aimed to attract foreigners diminishes in importance.\n",

            "The University of Gdańsk is a dynamically developing institution of higher learning, and one that combines respect for tradition with a commitment to the new. It offers education in nearly all fields of academic knowledge, in sought-after professions on the job market and in state-of-the-art facilities in its Gdańsk, Sopot and Gdynia campuses. It is currently one of the most modern academic centres in Poland.\n",
            "The University of Gdańsk was founded on 20 March 1970. It was formed from an amalgamation of two institutions of higher education: the Higher Economics School in Sopot and the Higher Pedagogical School in Gdańsk. Later, it also included the Higher Teacher Training School. The precursor of the Higher Economics School in Sopot was the Higher School of Maritime Trade in Sopot, which opened in 1945 and awarded its first degrees in 1947.\n",
            "20 March 2020 marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the University of Gdańsk, at present the largest university in the Pomeranian region, which has had an indisputable influence on the development of modern Poland, science and higher education. We have eleven faculties with over 25 thousand students, doctoral students and post-graduates, who are taught by more than one thousand seven hundred academic staff. In such fields of study as Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry, Oceanography, Quantum Physics, Pedagogy, Psychology, Law  and Economic Sciences, the University of Gdańsk is one of the best institutions in Poland.\n",
            "The University of Gdańsk is involved (as one of five Polish universities) in the creation of a network of European universities selected in the ‘European Universities’ competition organised by the European Commission. In conjunction with its partners, the University of Cádiz (Spain), the University of Split (Croatia), the Université de Bretagne Occidentale (France), Kiel University (Germany) and the University of Malta (Malta), the University of Gdańsk forms a consortium of the European University of the Seas (SEA-EU).

In the areas of social sciences and the humanities, the broadly defined intercultural research is particularly noteworthy, encompassing studies of international relations from a great variety of perspectives, cultural, economic, linguistic or in relation to international communication. Research into psychological diagnosis is also very strongly represented. As regards research into literary studies, mention should be made of extensive, long-term research programmes such as studies of the output and reception of Bruno Schulz or research into 20th-century traumas such as the Holocaust.  University of Gdańsk historians have notable academic achievements to their credit regarding the medieval and modern history of Gdańsk, while archaeologists are present in Iraq, Turkey or Macedonia and ethnographers conduct studies of, amongst others, the culture of Aboriginal peoples. Research into the language and culture of Kashubia also constitutes an important element of the University’s academic activity.\n",

Due to the endeavours of UG academic staff, the University has become a business incubator in such fields as biotechnology, biology or chemistry.\n",
            "The University of Gdańsk has been listed in the most important world rankings, thus joining the ranks of the best Polish universities. Its presence in such international rankings as the QS World University Ranking or the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Ranking is a reflection of the high quality of education, scientific research conducted and increasing international standing as well as  a high level of knowledge transfer to the economy. The dynamic development of the University of Gdańsk is reflected in its presence amongst the world’s 400 best young universities in the Times Higher Education (THE) Young University Rankings 2019 in which the University of Gdańsk was the only Polish university to feature. Environmental sciences also rank high in the Academic Ranking of World Universities, with the highest scoring field in the entire university and one of the highest in Poland on the basis of the quality of scientific publications, number of citations and international cooperation.

            "The University remains faithful to its original 1970 motto – In mari via tua (The sea is your way). The University’s maritime authority has been substantiated by the excellent and internationally renowned research stations – the Institute of Oceanography’s Prof. Krzysztof Skóra Hel Marine Station, the Bird Migration Research Station and the Biological Station in Sobieszewo. The University’s maritime image is also reflected in its fields of study, specialities and research connected with the sea and in particular with the Baltic coast. It features most prominently at faculties such as the Faculty of Biology or the Faculty of Oceanography and Geography, in such fields of study as Biology, Geography, Environmental Protection or Oceanography but is also present at the Faculty of Chemistry, in its involvement in research into the protection of the marine environment, or the Faculty of Law and Administration, focused on research into maritime law, urban structure of Pomerania or marine forensic science.
